Student will be able to
create forever loops using while and break
use incrementing variables in a while loop
control while loops using Boolean operators
# [ ] use a "forever" while loop to get user input of integers to add to sum, 
# until a non-digit is entered, then break the loop and print sum
sum = 0


# [ ] use a while True loop (forever loop) to give 4 chances for input of a correct color in a rainbow
# rainbow = "red orange yellow green blue indigo violet"


# [ ] Get input for a book title, keep looping while input is Not in title format (title is every word capitalized)
title = ""


# [ ] create a math quiz question and ask for the solution until the input is correct


Fix the Error
# [ ] review the code, run, fix the error
tickets = input("enter tickets remaining (0 to quit): ")

while tickets > 0:
        # if tickets are multiple of 3 then "winner"
    if int(tickets/3) == tickets/3:
        print("you win!")
    else:
        print("sorry, not a winner.")
    tickets = int(input("enter tickets remaining (0 to quit): "))

print("Game ended")
    

create a function: quiz_item() that asks a question and tests if input is correct
quiz_item()has 2 parameter strings: question and solution
shows question, gets answer input
returns True if answer == solution or continues to ask question until correct answer is provided
use a while loop
create 2 or more quiz questions that call quiz_item()
Hint: provide multiple choice or T/F answers

# Create quiz_item() and 2 or more quiz questions that call quiz_item()
